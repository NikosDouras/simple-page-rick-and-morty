# simple-page-rick-and-morty

It's a very simple FunPage made mainly with a free template from "HTML5UP".

There is a "Contact Us" section where the user can send his message to the admin (me) and also receive a copy of his message.

The main page is based on a free template from "HTML5UP", and is running on "render.com".

The "Contact Us" section is made by me with very simple html/css code and is running on "pythonanyhere.com"

All the pages are using flask and the mails are sent via smtplib.
